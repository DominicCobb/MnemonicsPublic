            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The general name of <strong>mnemonics</strong>, or <em>memoria technica,</em> was the name applied to devices for aiding the memory, to enable the mind to reproduce a relatively unfamiliar idea, and especially a series of dissociated ideas, by connecting it, or them, in some artificial whole, the parts of which are mutually suggestive. Mnemonic devices were much cultivated by Greek sophists and philosophers and are frequently referred to by Plato and Aristotle. In later times the poet Simonides was credited for development of these techniques, perhaps for no reason other than that the power of his memory was famous. Cicero, who attaches considerable importance to the art, but more to the principle of order as the best help to memory, speaks of Carneades (perhaps Charmades) of Athens and Metrodorus of Scepsis as distinguished examples of people<br />who used well-ordered images to aid the memory. The Romans valued such help in order to support facility in public speaking.</p>
            <p>The Greek and the Roman system of mnemonics was founded on the use of mental places and signs or pictures, known as "topical" mnemonics. The most usual method was to choose a large house, of which the apartments, walls, windows, statues, furniture, etc., were each associated with certain names, phrases, events or ideas, by means of symbolic pictures. To recall these, an individual had only to search over the apartments of the house until discovering the places where images had been placed by the imagination.</p>
            <p>In accordance with this system, if it were desired to fix a historic date in memory, it was localised in an imaginary town divided into a certain number of districts, each with ten houses, each house with ten rooms, and each room with a hundred quadrates or memory-places, partly on the floor, partly on the four walls, partly on the ceiling. Therefore, if it were desired to fix in the memory the date of the invention of printing (1436), an imaginary book, or some other symbol of printing, would be placed in the thirty-sixth quadrate or memory-place of the fourth room of the first house of the historic district of the town. Except that the rules of mnemonics are referred to by Martianus Capella, nothing further is known regarding the practice until the 13th century</p>
            <p>Among the voluminous writings of Roger Bacon is a tractate <em>De arte memorativa</em>. Ramon Llull devoted special attention to mnemonics in connection with his <em>ars generalis.</em> The first important modification of the method of the Romans was that invented by the German poet Konrad Celtes, who, in his <em>Epitoma in utramque Ciceronis rhetoricam cum arte memorativa nova</em> (1492), used letters of the alphabet for associations, rather than places. About the end of the 15th century, Petrus de Ravenna (b. 1448) provoked such astonishment in Italy by his mnemonic feats that he was believed by many to be a necromancer. His book, <em>Phoenix artis memoriae</em> (Venice, 1491, 4 vols.) went through as many as nine editions, the seventh being published at Cologne in 1608.</p>
            <pIt was about the end of the 16th century, when Lambert Schenkel (<em>Gazophylacium</em>, 1610), who taught mnemonics in France, Italy and Germany, similarly surprised people with his memory. He was denounced as a sorcerer by the University of Louvain, but in 1593 he published his tractate <em>De memoria</em> at Douai with the sanction of that celebrated theological faculty. The most complete account of his system is given in two works by his pupil Martin Sommer, published in Venice in 1619. In 1618 John Willis (d. 1628?) published <em>Mnemonica; sive ars reminiscendi</em>, containing a clear statement of the principles of topical or local mnemonics. Giordano Bruno included a <em>memoria technica</em> in his treatise <em>De umbris idearum,</em> as part of his study of the <em>ars generalis</em> of Llull. Other writers of this period are the Florentine Publicius (1482); Johannes Romberch (1533); Hieronimo Morafiot, <em>Ars memoriae</em> (1602);and B. Porta, <em>Ars reminiscendi</em> (1602).</p>
            <p>In 1648 Stanislaus Mink von Wennsshein revealed what he called the "most fertile secret" in mnemonics &mdash; using consonants for figures, thus expressing numbers by words (vowels being added as required), in order to create associations more readily remembered. The philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz adopted an alphabet very similar to that of Wennsshein for his scheme of a form of writing common to all languages.</p>
            <p>Wennsshein\'s method was adopted with slight changes afterward by the majority of subsequent "original" systems. It was modified and supplemented by Richard Grey (1694-1771), a priest who published a <em>Memoria technica</em> in 1730. The principal part of Grey\'s method is briefly this:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>To remember anything in history, chronology, geography, etc., a word is formed, the beginning whereof, being the first syllable or syllables of the thing sought, does, by frequent repetition, of course draw after it the latter part, which is so contrived as to give the answer. Thus, in history, the Deluge happened in the year before Christ two thousand three hundred forty-eight; this is signified by the word Del-<em>etok</em>, Del standing for Deluge and <em>etok</em> for 2348.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>(His method is comparable to the Hebrew system by which letters also stand for numerals, and therefore words for dates.)</p>
            <p>To assist in retaining the mnemonical words in the memory, they were formed into memorial lines. Such strange words in difficult hexameter scansion, are by no means easy to memorise. The vowel or consonant, which Grey connected with a particular figure, was chosen arbitrarily.</p>
            <p>A later modification was made in 1806 by Gregor von Feinaigle, a German monk from Salem near Constance. While living and working in Paris, he expounded a system of mnemonics in which (as in Wennsshein) the numerical figures are represented by letters chosen due to some similarity to the figure or an accidental connection with it. This alphabet was supplemented by a complicated system of localities and signs. Feinaigle, who apparently did not publish any written documentation of this method, travelled to England in 1811. The following year one of his pupils published <em>The New Art of Memory</em> (1812), giving Feinaigle\'s system. In addition, it contains valuable historical material about previous systems.</p>
            <p>Other mnemonists later published simplified forms, as the more complicated menemonics were generally abandoned. Methods founded chiefly on the so-called laws of association (cf. Mental association) were taught with some success in Germany.</p>

            <h2>Mnemonic</h2>
            <p>A <strong>mnemonic</strong> <strong>device</strong>, or <strong>memory device</strong>, is any learning technique that aids information retention or retrieval (remembering) in the human memory. Mnemonics make use of elaborative encoding, retrieval cues, and imagery as specific tools to encode any given information in a way that allows for efficient storage and retrieval. Mnemonics aid original information in becoming associated with something more accessible or meaningful&mdash;which, in turn, provides better retention of the information.</p>
            <p>Commonly encountered mnemonics are often used for lists and in auditory form, such as short poems, acronyms, initialisms, or memorable phrases, but mnemonics can also be used for other types of information and in visual or kinesthetic forms. Their use is based on the observation that the human mind more easily remembers spatial, personal, surprising, physical, sexual, humorous, or otherwise "relatable" information, rather than more abstract or impersonal forms of information.</p>
            <p>The word "mnemonic" is derived from the Ancient Greek word &mu;&nu;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&nu;&iota;&kappa;ό&sigmaf; (<em>mnēmonikos</em>), meaning "of memory, or relating to memory" and is related to Mnemosyne ("remembrance"), the name of the goddess of memory in Greek mythology. Both of these words are derived from &mu;&nu;ή&mu;&eta; (<em>mnēmē</em>), "remembrance, memory". Mnemonics in antiquity were most often considered in the context of what is today known as the art of memory.</p>
            <p>Ancient Greeks and Romans distinguished between two types of memory: the "natural" memory and the "artificial" memory. The former is inborn, and is the one that everyone uses instinctively. The latter in contrast has to be trained and developed through the learning and practice of a variety of mnemonic techniques.</p>
            <p>Mnemonic systems are techniques or strategies consciously used to improve memory. They help use information already stored in long-term memory to make memorization an easier task.</p>
            <p>Mnemonics allows you to remember information from a single perception of each element. For example, 100 random words (numbers) can be remembered sequentially with an average interval of 6 seconds.</p>

            <h2>The main method of memorization in modern mnemonics</h2>
            <p>Memorization in mnemonics is based on the property of memory to very quickly remember the connection between simultaneously perceived images (or, what is the same, the connection between images created in the imagination).</p>
            <p>The illustrated system of figurative codes is one of the main methods of memorization, along with the “shock method” - the method of forming an artificial association (the connection of several images with parts of one image).</p>
            <p>The volume of memorization with the help of mnemonics is limited by a rather low memorization speed (on average 6 seconds per record in the memory of one connection). Mnemonic memorization is similar to figurative notes: the most important is also remembered in the form of visual images.</p>
            <p>When storing large amounts of information in one form or another, a mental mnemonic process and a method of remembering grouping are used, including: breaking the array into fragments known and unknown to humans; combining the elements of each unknown fragment into a single integral memory object; linking all known and combined fragments of the array into a whole; repetition of actions for breaking down, combining and linking to the final result in the form of a set of associatively connected memory objects, providing convenient easy access to memory to the contents of the original information array as a whole</p>
            <p>In the modern interpretation, <strong>mnemonics</strong> means the whole set of techniques and methods of remembering information used in a particular system, and the term  <strong>mnemonics</strong> is interpreted as a practical application of the methods defined in this particular mnemonics.</p>

            <h2>Types</h2>
            <dl>
            <dt>1. Music mnemonics</dt>
            <dd>Songs and jingles can be used as a mnemonic. A common example is how children remember the alphabet by singing the ABCs.</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
            <dt>2. Name mnemonics (acronym)</dt>
            <dd>The first letter of each word is combined into a new word. For example: VIBGYOR (or ROY G BIV) for the colours of the rainbow or HOMES for the Great Lakes.</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
            <dt>3. Expression or word mnemonics</dt>
            <dd>The first letter of each word is combined to form a phrase or sentence — e.g. "Richard of York gave battle in vain" for the colours of the rainbow.</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
            <dt>4. Model mnemonics</dt>
            <dd>A model is used to help recall information. Applications of this method involve the use of diagrams, cycles, graphs, and flowcharts to help understand or memorize an idea. e.g. cell cycle, pie charts, pyramid models.</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
            <dt>5. Ode mnemonics</dt>
            <dd>The information is placed into a poem or doggerel, — e.g. "Note socer, gener, liberi, and Liber god of revelry, like puer these retain the \'e\'" (most Latin nouns of the second declension ending in -er drop the -e in all of the oblique cases except the vocative, these are the exceptions).</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
            <dt>6. Note organization mnemonics</dt>
            <dd>The method of note organization can be used as a memorization technique. Applications of this method involve the use of flash cards and lists. Flash cards are used by putting a question or word on one side of a paper and the answer or definition on the other side of the paper. Lists involve the organization of data from broad to detailed. e.g. Earth &rarr; Continent &rarr; Country.</dd>

            <dl>
            <dt>7. Image mnemonics</dt>
            <dd>The information is constructed into a picture — e.g. the German weak declension can be remembered as five \'-e\'s\', looking rather like the state of Oklahoma in America, in a sea of \'-en\'s\'.</dd>

            <h2>Mnemonic link system | Chain method</h2>
            <p>A <strong>mnemonic link system</strong>, sometimes also known as a <strong>chain method</strong>, is a method of remembering lists that is based on creating an association between the elements of that list. For example, when memorizing the list (dog, envelope, thirteen, yarn, window), one could create a story about a "dog stuck in an envelope, mailed to an unlucky thirteen primaryTextColor cat playing with yarn by the window". It is argued that the story would be easier to remember than the list itself.</p>
            <p>Another method is to actually link each element of the list with a mental picture of an image that includes two elements in the list that are next to each other. This would form an open doubly linked list which could be traversed at will, backwards or forwards. For example, in the last list one could imagine their dog inside of a giant envelope, then a primaryTextColor cat eating an envelope. The same logic would be used with the rest of the items. The observation that absurd images are easier to remember is known as the Von Restorff effect, although the success of this effect was refuted by several studies (Hock et al. 1978; Einstein 1987), which found that the established connection between the two words is more important than the image\'s absurdity.</p>
            <p>In order to access a certain element of the list, one needs to recite the list step by step, much in the same vein as a linked list, in order to get the element from the system.</p>
            <p>There are three limitations to the link system. The first is that there is no numerical order imposed when memorizing, hence the practitioner cannot immediately determine the numerical position of an item; this can be solved by bundling numerical markers at set points in the chain or using the peg system instead. The second is that if any of the items is forgotten, the entire list may be in jeopardy. The third is the potential for confusing repeated segments of the list, a common problem when memorizing binary digits. This limitation can be resolved either through bundling or by using either the peg system or the method of loci.</p>

            <h2>"Russian Doll" Method</h2>
            <p>Unlike the Chain method in this method, in each pair, the first image is large and the second is small. Since small images are poorly remembered, they resort to the following:<br />Let\'s connect two images: a picture and a chair. Imagine a picture that you know well. Imagine a chair nearby. Now "turn on" in the imagination the approximation of the image.<br />Enlarge the picture so that in your consciousness there is only, say, the signature of the artist in the lower right corner. It should be the size of an apple. The size of the chair does not need to be increased. Now combine the two images: the signature of the artist and the chair. Lock this link in for a few seconds.<br />If you now imagine the picture, then the chair will turn out to be very small on it. In that<br />and the main point of the "Matryoshka" reception lies. When memorizing this trick<br />images are constantly increasing and decreasing. As well as recalling<br />images remembered by this technique.</p>

            <h2>Method of loci | Cicero method</h2>
            <p>The <strong>method of loci</strong> (<em>loci</em> being Latin for "places") is a strategy of memory enhancement which uses visualizations of familiar spatial environments in order to enhance the recalling of information. The method of loci is also known as the <strong>memory journey</strong>, <strong>memory palace</strong>, or <strong>Cicero method</strong>, or <strong>mind palace technique</strong>. This method is a mnemonic device adopted in ancient Roman and Greek rhetorical treatises (in the anonymous <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium</em>, Cicero\'s <em>De Oratore</em>, and Quintilian\'s <em>Institutio Oratoria</em>). Many memory contest champions report using this technique to recall faces, digits, and lists of words.</p>
            <p>The term is most often found in specialised works on psychology, neurobiology, and memory, though it was used in the same general way at least as early as the first half of the nineteenth century in works on rhetoric, logic, and philosophy. John O\'Keefe and Lynn Nadel refer to:</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>\'the method of loci\', an imaginal technique known to the ancient Greeks and Romans and described by Yates (1966) in her book <em>The Art of Memory</em> as well as by Luria (1969). In this technique the subject memorizes the layout of some building, or the arrangement of shops on a street, or any geographical entity which is composed of a number of discrete loci. When desiring to remember a set of items the subject \'walks\' through these loci in their imagination and commits an item to each one by forming an image between the item and any feature of that locus. Retrieval of items is achieved by \'walking\' through the loci, allowing the latter to activate the desired items. The efficacy of this technique has been well established (Ross and Lawrence 1968, Crovitz 1969, 1971, Briggs, Hawkins and Crovitz 1970, Lea 1975), as is the minimal interference seen with its use.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The items to be remembered in this mnemonic system are mentally associated with specific physical locations. The method relies on memorized spatial relationships to establish order and recollect memorial content. It is also known as the "Journey Method", used for storing lists of related items, or the "Roman Room" technique, which is most effective for storing unrelated information.</p>

            <p>Before applying this method, you need to decide for yourself what <strong>sequence of walking around the room</strong> you will follow. In other words, you need to determine the sequence of places where you will post your information, that is, <strong>prepare</strong> a reference list of places. Many will just have to keep it in their heads.</p>

            <p>If this is difficult, then, remembering the sequence of elements by the Cicero method for the first time, you can try to walk around the room really, just like him, while arranging the elements mentally. In other cases, pacing around the house, as Cicero did, is not necessary: it is enough to imagine her mentally (the room, of course, must be very familiar). However, it can be any well-known location.</p>

            <p>The Cicero method is based on natural associations, that is, on the connections that are formed in the brain in a natural way with regular perception of visual images that have interconnections. Each person regularly sees the same visual images. These are objects in an apartment, office. These are objects on the street that you often walk along. Since the connections between regularly perceived objects already exist in your brain, these connections do not need to be remembered. You remember them anyway. For the formation of supporting images by the Cicero method, one should only well fix in memory the sequence of images familiar to you. This is done by recalling them repeatedly.</p>

            <h2>Singling Out Support Images Using Cicero Method | Method of loci</h2>
            <p>Example. Define the sequence of rooms in your house or apartment, office or your friends’ houses. For example, always memorize rooms in the following order: corridor, bathroom, kitchen, small room, and dining room.</p>
            <p>Concentrate your attention on one particular room. Say, your corridor. Walk around the corridor in your imagination (always in the same direction - clockwise) and remember 10 different objects.</p>
            <p>Do the same with other rooms of your apartment. Single out 10 images in the bathroom, in the kitchen, the small room and the dining room.</p>
            <p>As a result, you will have 50 images. First, you remember 10 images in the corridor, then – 10 images in the kitchen, and so on.</p>
            <p>Fix the 50 images and their order in your memory using multiple REMEMBERING.</p>
            <p>This is important!</p>
            <p>The selected images MUST NOT REPEAT THEMSELVES. Only object names can be repeated. Single out images by remembering them. <br>You need to extract the connections that are already present in the brain. Choose the images that would later allow you to single out 5 more images from them.</p>
            <p>The Cicero method is used to form a system of support (stimulating) images. The support image system is formed via a combination of different sequence memorization techniques. The images selected with the Cicero method are usually FIRST-LEVEL images in the support image system. If we draw parallels with a computer, they are a parent directory or a root catalogue, through which you come to other support images.</p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vlpQHJ09do">Example</a>
            <p>The task for you is to <strong>prepare</strong>, for beginning, <strong>10 support images</strong>. In the future, this number will be increased.</p>

            <p>For almost all mnemonists, the Roman room method is fundamental. Therefore, do not be lazy - this is a reserve for the future.</p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PIbz_gKw0XY">Another explanation</a>
            <p>To get started - <strong>prepare</strong> 10 reference images according to the method of the Roman room. These should be objects / locations from an area known to you (your apartment, office, road to the store, etc.). You must select these images in a certain order, which you will adhere to in the future.</p>
            <p>After you prepare 10 reference images - proceed with the exercise.</p>
            <p>It will be necessary to remember <strong>10 words</strong> using the Cicero \ Roman room method. For this:</p>
            <ul>
            <li style="text-align: left;">visualize every word clearly</li>
            <li style="text-align: left;">connect the word with the reference image, not forgetting:</li>
            <ul>
            <li>clearly distinguish the first and second image of the pair</li>
            <li>to build uniformity in memorizing images - place the second image on top of the first, on the right side of the first, or inside the first</li>
            <li>the images in pairs should be about the same size</li>
            <li>do not imagine images separately, but try to create contact between them</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>When “remembering” images, mentally go along the same path, carefully “looking” in the imagination for the support images with which you will remember memorized words.</p>
            <p>Time after time you will do it faster and faster, honing this skill.</p>
            <p> Good luck! </p>

            <h3><span id="Assigning_sounds_to_digits" class="mw-headline">Assigning sounds to digits</span></h3>
            <p>Here you can see or change names of tips for numbers.</p>
            <p>Each numeral is associated with one or more consonants. Vowels and the consonants w, h, and y are ignored. These can be used as "fillers" to make sensible words from the resulting consonant sequences. Mapping:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>0 = [/s/, /z/]</li>
            <li>1 = [/t/, /d/]</li>
            <li>2 = [/n/]</li>
            <li>3 = [/m/]</li>
            <li>4 = [/r/]</li>
            <li>5 = [/l/]</li>
            <li>6 = [/tʃ/, /dʒ/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/]</li>
            <li>7 = [/k/, /ɡ/]</li>
            <li>8 = [/f/, /v/]</li>
            <li>9 = [/p/, /b/]</li>
            <li>unassigned = [/h/, /j/, /w/, vowel sounds]</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example to memorize 69 - we should use sounds 6 = [/tʃ/, /dʒ/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/] and 9 = [/p/, /b/] and figure out the word. And we get the word-image for memoriznig - <em>JeeP<em>.</em></em></p>
            <p>And here are the mnemonic techniques for remembering:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>0 = Zero begins with z (and /z/). Upper case S and Z, as well as lower case s and z, have zero vertical strokes each, as with the numeral 0. The alveolar fricatives /s/ and /z/ form a voiceless and voiced pair</li>
            <li>1 = Upper case T and D, as well as lower case t and d have one vertical stroke each, as with the numeral 1. The alveolar stops /t/ and /d/ form a voiceless and voiced pair, as do the similar-sounding dental fricatives /&theta;/ and /&eth;/, though some variant systems may omit the latter pair</li>
            <li>2 = Upper case N and lower case n each have two vertical strokes and two points on the baseline</li>
            <li>3 = Lower case m has three vertical strokes. Both upper case M and lower case m each have three points on the baseline and look like the numeral 3 on its side</li>
            <li>4 = Four ends with r (and /r/ in rhotic accents)</li>
            <li>5 = L is the Roman numeral for 50. Among the five digits of one\'s left hand, the thumb and index fingers also form an L</li>
            <li>6 = Upper case G and lower case g look like the numeral 6 flipped horizontally and rotated 180&deg; respectively. Lower case script j tends to have a lower loop, like the numeral 6. In some serif fonts, upper case CH, SH and ZH each have six serifs. The postalveolar affricates /tʃ/ and /dʒ/ form a voiceless and voiced pair, as do the similar-sounding postalveolar fricatives /ʃ/ and /ʒ/. CHurch has six letters</li>
            <li>7 = Both upper case K and lower case k look like two small 7s on their sides. In some fonts, the lower-right part of the upper case G looks like a 7. G is also the 7th letter of the alphabet. The velar stops /k/ and /g/ form a voiceless and voiced pair</li>
            <li>8 = Lower case script f, which tends to have an upper and lower loop, looks like a figure-8. The labiodental fricatives /f/ and /v/ form a voiceless and voiced pair</li>
            <li>9 = Upper case P and lower case p look like the numeral 9 flipped horizontally. Lower case b looks like the numeral 9 turned 180&deg;. The labial stops /p/ and /b/ form a voiceless and voiced pair</li>
            <li>unassigned = Vowel sounds, semivowels (/j/ and /w/) and /h/ do not correspond to any number. They can appear anywhere in a word without changing its number value</li>

            <p><span style = "text-decoration: underline;"> <em>Memo Index</em> </span> [<em>MI</em>] = (<em> number_of_correct_responses </em> + ( <em> number_of_memorized_numbers </em> - <em> elapsed_time / 6) </em> </p>
            <p><em> Explanation.</em></p>
            <p>Since the average time of 1 number memorizing = 6 seconds, when memorizing 10 numbers in 60 seconds (10 * 6), we obtain a memory index of 10. This corresponds to and displays the person\'s ability to memorize information.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, if a person remembers 10 numbers in 120 seconds (12 * 10), and 12 seconds is the maximum time per 1 number remembering, then the coefficient will be 0.</p>
            <p>If you memorized faster than the average 60 seconds, say, 30 seconds, then the coefficient will be 15, which encourages quick memorization. </p>

            <h3> Deck images </h3>

            <p> Here you can watch and change the names of card tips. <br>
            Initially given the name of the system, which are built on the principle: </p>
            <p> Name = Suit + Value <br>
            For example - 2 of clubs = [suit = clubs = С] + [value = 2 = [N] = [C, N] = the word CoiN </p>

            <p>Suit:<br>
            <br>• Hearts - "H"
            <br>• Spades - "S"
            <br>• Clubs - "C"
            <br>• Diamonds - "D"</p>

            <p>Because there are 13 cards of each suit we have next system to avoid memorizing mistakes:</p>

            <p>Values (cards):<br>

            <br>• 10 = 0 = [ s, z ]
            <br>• Ace = [ t, d ] like 1
            <br>• 2 = [ n ]
            <br>• 3 = [ m ]
            <br>• 4 = [ r ]
            <br>• 5 = [ L ]
            <br>• 6 = [ g / sh ]
            <br>• 7 = [ k ]
            <br>• 8 = [ f, v ]
            <br>• 9 = [ p, b ]
            <br>• Jack = suit name
            <br>• Queen = rhyme with queen
            <br>• King = rhyme with king</p>
            <p>There a variety of different systems to memorize deck of card. You can use this one or create your own based on your taste.</p>

            <h3>Assigning sounds to digits</h3>
            <p>Here you can see or change names of tips for numbers.</p>
            <p>Each numeral is associated with one or more consonants. Vowels and the consonants w, h, and y are ignored. These can be used as "fillers" to make sensible words from the resulting consonant sequences. Mapping:</p>

            <p>• 0 = [/s/, /z/]
            <br>• 1 = [/t/, /d/]
            <br>• 2 = [/n/]
            <br>• 3 = [/m/]
            <br>• 4 = [/r/]
            <br>• 5 = [/l/]
            <br>• 6 = [/tʃ/, /dʒ/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/]
            <br>• 7 = [/k/, /ɡ/]
            <br>• 8 = [/f/, /v/]
            <br>• 9 = [/p/, /b/]
            <br>• unassigned = [/h/, /j/, /w/, vowel sounds]</p>

            <p>For example to memorize 69 - we should use sounds 6 = [/tʃ/, /dʒ/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/] and 9 = [/p/, /b/] and figure out the word. And we get the word-image for memorizing - <i>JeeP<i>.</p>

            <p>And here it is mnemonic for remembering:<br>

            <br>• 0 = Zero begins with z (and /z/). S, Z have zero vertical strokes each, as with the numeral 0.
            <br>• 1 = T and D have one vertical stroke each, as with the numeral 1.
            <br>• 2 = N has two vertical strokes and two points on the baseline
            <br>• 3 = Lower case m has three vertical strokes. Both upper case M and lower case m each have three points on the baseline.
            <br>• 4 = Four ends with r (and /r/ in rhotic accents)
            <br>• 5 = L is the Roman numeral for 50.
            <br>• 6 = G looks like the numeral 6 flipped horizontally and rotated 180° respectively. Lower case script j tends to have a lower loop, like the numeral 6.
            <br>• 7 = K looks like two small 7s on their sides. G is the 7th letter of the alphabet.
            <br>• 8 = Lower case script f, which tends to have an upper and lower loop, looks like a figure-8.
            <br>• 9 = P looks like the numeral 9 flipped horizontally. Lower case b looks like the numeral 9 turned 180°.
            <br>• unassigned = Vowel sounds, semivowels (/j/ and /w/) and /h/ do not correspond to any number. They can appear anywhere in a word without changing its number value</br>
